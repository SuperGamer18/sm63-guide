# sm63-guide
This is an 100% guide for the 2009 Flash game Super Mario 63. This repo wll be mostly blank due to the nature of this piece of text. The objective here is to provide a definitve 100% guide for this nostalgic game. Feel free to improve the guide or this repo (if doing the latter, it is preferable that you either make an issue or a PR).

Grab Super Mario 63's source code here: https://github.com/runouw/Super-Mario-63 (also has compiled builds, although if you just want to play the game, Flashpoint is recommended, which can be obtained from here: https://flashpointarchive.org/downloads)
